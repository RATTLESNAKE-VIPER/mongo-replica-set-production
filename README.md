## Introduction

This repo is in charge of creating a 3 nodes replica set with mongoDB **ALMOST** ready for production. This will:

- Provision with terraform the necessary resources (ssh keys, ips, security groups, instances, volumes...)
- Setup mongodb with a 3 node replicaset and one arbiter.
- Setup monitoring using [percona pmm](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management) (based on prometheus and grafana).
- Setup automatic backup with AWS S3


I invite you to have an fresh/clean environment (4 nodes newly created).

This is under MIT liscence so you can use it and modify it as you want.

## Note on the network security

In this repository I am trying to make something generic whatever the underlying stack. If you want to use it on specific cloud vendor you can follow their directives to perfectly secure your infrastructure.

### AWS

If the consumer of your database is in an AWS stack it is recommanded to run your DB on multiple AZ, on private subnets in a VPC with a NAT Gateway so that the DB has no access to internet except through the NAT Gateway. You can then use a route 53 private zone and use your own certificates (official certificates).

## Security: What is covered ?

According to the [security checklist](https://docs.mongodb.com/v3.2/administration/security-checklist/):

- [x] Enable Access Control and Enforce Authentication: We will create a userAdminAnyDatabase, root and dedicated user

- [x] Configure Role-Based Access Control: We will create a userAdminAnyDatabase, root and dedicated user

- [x] Encrypt Communication: We will use lets encrypt to generate tls certificate + accessKey for communication between members.

- [x] Encrypt and Protect Data: We will use encryption at rest (with LVM and Luks)

- [x] Limit Network Exposure: This is achieved with security groups when using terraform

- [ ] Audit System Activity: As this is an Entreprise feature we won't see it in this article

- [x] Run MongoDB with a Dedicated User: We will run mongod with user mongodb (group mongodb)

- [x] Run MongoDB with Secure Configuration Options: We will deactivate script with the mongod.conf security.javascriptEnabled. As well net.http.enabled, net.http.RESTInterfaceEnabled, net.http.JSONPEnabled are by default deactivated as mentionned here

- [ ] Request a Security Technical Implementation Guide: This is out of scope. This needs to be done by the system administrator. You can request a copy

- [ ] Consider Security Standards Compliance: This is out of scope. This needs to be done by the system administrator. You can take a look here MongoDB Security Reference Architecture

## Setup with terraform

We will use terraform v0.12.20

> Please note that you will be charged by your cloud provider.

Currently here are the providers implemented (don't hesitate to contribute to add new providers):

- [x] Scaleway 
- [x] AWS
- [ ] Openstack on premise
- [ ] Openstack OVH
- [ ] GCP
- [ ] Azure

What will be created (the resources names can differ from a cloud provider to another but have the same behavior):

- 4 Elastic IPs (public fixed IPs)
- 1 security group with following rules
  - Allow all port from Devops home (called `home_ip` in variables)
  - Allow port 80 and 443 from everywhere to allow later letsencrypt renewal (closing of the port will be done with firewalld. See ansible section)
  - Allow port 27017 from all members of the security groups
  - Allow ports 42000 to 42005 from all members of the security groups (for monitoring)
  - Allow port 8443 from all members of the security groups (for monitoring)
- 4 instances (one for each nodes)
- 4 volumes attached to the 4 nodes

### Scaleway setup

To setup scaleway you need to go on the Dashboard then in **Credentials** and go to **API TOKEN** section. 
Generate a new key (be carreful the private key will be shown just one time).
When it is done add them in the `terraform/scaleway/variable.tf`.

### AWS setup

To setup AWS you need to go on IAM and create a new user with EC2FullAccess (be carreful the private key will be shown just one time)
When it is done you need before running terraform to export the AWS variable:

```
$ export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="<access_key>"
$ export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="<secret key>"
$ export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="eu-west-3"
```

### RUN

```
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
# When ready run
$ terraform apply
# To destroy your stack
$ terraform destroy
```

## Pre-install setup

### DNS

You need an official domain name as it will be used for Lets encrypt SSL certificate generation/renewal.
All node needs subdomain registered in an official DNS.

Example: You are owner of `my-domain.com`
You need DNS entries:

```
NAME                             TTL         TYPE          DATA
mongo-1.my-domain.fr             3600        A             ip_mongo_1
mongo-2.my-domain.fr             3600        A             ip_mongo_2
mongo-3.my-domain.fr             3600        A             ip_mongo_3
mongo-arbiter.my-domain.fr       3600        A             ip_mongo_arbiter
```

### Sudo

Ensure that sudo is installed on all host and that user is in sudoer list (in `/etc/sudoers`)

### Access key

To not reuse the default mongodb keyfile you can run:

```
$ openssl rand -base64 756 > ansible/roles/security/files/mongo-keyfile
```

## Ansible

Here will use ansible 2.9

Thinks about modifying the `./ansible/hosts.yaml` file. Here is the signification of the differentes variables/children:

### mongodb
Here we will put all our host. You can notice variables such as:

- `host_name`: The name of the host.
- `host_ip`: The public IP of your host
- `host_private_ip`: Not mandatory. When using public IPs such as elastic ips in AWS, or flexible ips for scaleway. The `host_private_ip` will be used for mongodb binding. `host_ip` will be use to join monitoring server. The private ip can be found by launching command `ifconfig`
- `cron_renew_day`: this is the renewal day of week in cron language (0 for Sunday to 1 for Saturday). We will launch the job every week on this specific day at 03:30AM. You can notice that we don't set the same so in case of any issue you have 24 hours to fix it.


### primary/secondaries/arbiter
We could do this by using variable but I prefer in term of visibility to use dedicated children node even if I copy the host from mongodb hosts. This gives as well the possibility to add new variable such as the priority for secondaries.

### monitoring_server
The server on which the monitoring tools will be install. Can be your arbiter

### monitoring_clients
The server which will be monitored

### backup_server
The server on which the backup will be performed. Can be your arbiter

### Variables

- `remote_user`: the remote user which will be use to connect to vms
- `mongodb_replicaset_name`: the name you want to give to your replicaset
- `mongodb_db_path`: the path on which you want to store your data. Will be mounted on the encrypted partition
- `mongodb_user_user_admin_any_database_name`: the first user which will be created with rights userAdminAnyDatabase
- `mongodb_user_user_admin_any_database_password`: The password of the userAdminAnyDatabase user
- `mongodb_user_root_name`: The root user with rights root
- `mongodb_user_root_password`: The password of root user
- `mongodb_main_database`: The main database for your application
- `mongodb_user_readwrite_main_database_name`: A user with readWrite access on the main database
- `mongodb_user_readwrite_main_database_password`: The password of the readWrite user
- `partitioning_device_name`: The name of the device for partition used for encryption (ie: `/dev/sdb` for scaleway `/dev/nvme0n1` for ebs on aws)
- `partitioning_partition_name`: The name of the partition used for encryption (ie: `/dev/sdb1` for scaleway `/dev/nvme0n1p1` for ebs on aws)
- `partitioning_luks_passphrase`: The passphrase for your encryption. Keep this passphrase safe and don't loose it
- `partitioning_luks_name`: the name of the encrypted partition
- `partitioning_vg_name`: The LVM volume group name
- `partitioning_lv_name`: The LVM volume name
- `certbot_admin_email`: your email for certbot
- `monitoring_password`: the password used on grafana
- `monitoring_db_user_name`: the user in db which will have clusterMonitor role
- `monitoring_db_user_password`: the password of the clusterMonitor user
- `backup_db_user_name`: the user in db which will have backup role
- `backup_db_user_password`: the password of the backup user
- `backup_region`: the S3 region on which your bucket is hosted
- `backup_secret`: the secret key of your s3 user
- `backup_public`: the public key of your s3 user
- `backup_minute`: the minutes for your backup cron job
- `backup_hour`: the hour for your backup hour

### Run 

To run simply execute:

```
$ ansible-playbook -i ansible/hosts.yml playbook-full-configuration.yml
```

Here are the differents plays which will be executed:

- On all hosts:
  - `prepare-host`: Install MongoDB and perform some configuration (transparent_hugepage)
  - `encrypt-rest`: Create a volume with LVM and mount it on the future `mongodb_db_path`. The LVM will be created on an Encrypted device with LUKS
  - `security`: Use mongodb keyfile, install let's encrypt to use TLS termination. Add cron to renew the certificates
  - `mongodb`: Configure and start mongodb

- On primary:
  - `replica-set`: Init and configure replicaset (add secondaries and arbiter)
  - `monitoring-create-user`: Create all users (one with userAdminAnyDataBase rights, one with root and one with readWrite on the `mongodb_main_database`)

- On monitoring_server:
  - `monitoring-server`: Install and start monitoring server (pmm)

- On monitoring_clients:
  - `monitoring-clients`: Install monitoring client on all clients and join the server

- On primary:
  - `backup-create-user`: Create user with backup rights

- On backup_server:
  - `backup`: Create the backup cron job

If you just want to run some part you have some predefined playbooks.

### Replay

If you get an error most of the steps have checks so you can simply rerun the playbook after providing your fix.

### Connect to your DB

You can now connect to your DB from your `home_ip` with:

```
$ mongo "mongodb://mongo-1.my-domain.fr:27017,mongo-2.my-domain.fr:27017,mongo-3.my-domain.fr:27017/main?replicaSet=rs0" --ssl --username main-user --password "strong-password-3"
```

### Monitoring

As explained above monitoring is done with the really complete and powerfool opensource tool [percona pmm](https://www.percona.com/software/database-tools/percona-monitoring-and-management) (based on prometheus and grafana).
You will have access to plenty of data like:

- Node CPU, Memory, Network and disk usage
- MongoDB cluster summary, inMemoryDetails, Replicaset information and WiredTiger.
- Query analytic (to see query efficiency)

Here are some graphs:
